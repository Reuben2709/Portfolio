# About Me 
Currently i am a student at the Bournemouth and poole college. My ambitions are to become a skilled graphic designer as I am a creative person who loves being able to create what they imagine for a project. I feel like this creativity has come from doing years of music, which involved getting a merit in grade 5 music  theory and a merit in grade 6 trumpet. Which involves alot of hard work and dedication but also requires a creative mind to make the music stand out from just reading it off a manuscript. I feel that this is why I enjoy being able to create something and find it easy coming up with a design.
